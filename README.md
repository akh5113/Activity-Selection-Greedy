Homework 4
4/29/18

This program will take a text file named "act.txt", which will be formatted like this:
[number of activities for set 1]
[act 1], [start 1], [finish 1]
[act 2], [start 2], [finish 2]
...
[act n], [start n], [finish n]
[number of activities for set 2]
[act 1], [start 1], [finish 1]
...
etc.

The program will open the file, call the algorithm that will sort it in decending order 
from the last activity to start to the first activity to start (based on the start times)
and return the list of schedulable activities.  

It will then display the total amount of activities that it can do, and then list
the activities. 

To run this program on flip, type "python3 Homework4.py"
